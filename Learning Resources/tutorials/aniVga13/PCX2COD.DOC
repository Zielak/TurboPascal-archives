This is a small á-version goodie: you can use it to convert PCX-graphics
into *.COD or *.PIC files.
You need a mouse for this program to select the part of the picture you want
to convert and a SVGA-card to display large pictures in 256 color modes.
Press the left button and drag the mouse around: this will move the upper
left corner of your selection box. Press <Return> to save that area, <ESC>
will quit the program.
If your selected part is 320x200 pixels in size, the program will generate
a *.PIC file as output, all other sizes will result in *.COD files.
If the screen part you selected is to large to fit into 64K, the program
will tell you so. Note that you may produce sprites which fit into 64K, but
are to high or to wide to be read in by MAKES later on!

Oh yes: this is a BETA-version! Don't expect error-free behaviour!
