컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

V1.1 -> V1.2:

o corrected synchronisation correctly to "horizontal enable's" negative logic
o added new fade (Fade_Moiree15)
o MAKES: switched usage of some units to completely self-written ones;
  included sources
o MAKES: correctly disabled mouse call back at the end of the program
o replaced Dispose() by FreeMem() call in routine
o MAKES: inserted missing Close() in SavePalette() procedure
o introduced data compression algorithms into all programs; wrote (de-)compress
  program BFFFFFFF.EXE
o MAKES: made INT33h to save&restore SS:SP, too  (just to be on the safe side)
o MAKES: holding button pressed keeps drawing pixels
o added new LoadFont() routine (and some fonts)
o optimized synchronisation code to squeeze out some CPU cycles
o MAKES: forgot to call AdjustMouse() in routine ShowCursorDaten()
o MAKES: corrected workarea box from (0..320,0..200) to (0..319,0..199)
o MAKES: enhanced user interface; last used dir will be default for next input
o MAKES: used newest SVGA-driver
o added Colin Buckley's excellent UNCHAIN utility to enable proper debugging
  in tweaked graphic modes
o introduced windowed animations: SetAnimateWindow(), UpdateOuterArea, Win*
o added routine FreeSpriteMem() to get rid of no more used sprites; moved
  SpriteAd[] into IMPLEMENTATION-section therefore.
  Introduced two internal tables (SpriteSize[] & SpritePTR[]) and changed
  LoadSprite() and InitRoutines() accordingly
o moved BACKGNDPAGE to EMS/RAM-memory, introduced BACKGNADR as pointer to it
o uniformly made page-parameter "pa" of type WORD everywhere
o added routine CopyVRAMtoVRAM()
o changed PutPixel- and Line-routines to clip to animation window if wanted;
  introduced variable WinClip for this purpose
o added SetSplitIndex() & GetSplitIndex(), to support selective clipping for
  sprites, too
o added MakeSpriteText()-routine
o added MakeTileArea() for simplified background tiling
o added fade in's, fade out's (and more) by FadeToPalette()
o MAKES: added command line switch "/480" to use 640x480x256 as graphic mode
o added FindFile() routine to improve file name handling
o omitted TRANSLAT-utility from the package and added a pre-translated
  English version ANIVGA.ENG to the package
o changed last column handling in sprite saving routines

_____________________________________________________________________________

V1.0 -> V1.1:

o Added compiler switches $G-,$I-,$F-,$X-,$N-,$L+ for completeness
o changed code so that it works for code generation with $G+
o changed page flipping; ANIVGA now synchronizes to "display enable" (instead
  of vertical retrace)
o killed a few documentation flaws
o completely rewrote GRAB: may use either BIOS or built-in screen access
  routines, supports mouse
o rewrote ANIVGA code to use 16 bit screen accesses whereever it made sense
  (note that there are situations where it is *really* faster to work with 8
   bit accesses!)
o moved types PaletteEntry, Palette and PalettePtr into the interface-section
o constant DefaultColors, too
o rewrote SetShadowTab() completely - should be 5x faster now
o added new display mode Display_SHADOWEXACT
o added SetPalette() and GetPalette()
o told InitRoutines() to definetly set default color palette
o made SetShadowTab() work on actually set colors (instead upon the default
  colors)
o should detect whether it runs on a monochrome or color display - sorry, I
  don't have a monochrome one to test it out
o fixed bug in tiling scheme: surrounding area now uses tile #0 instead of the
  first tile (=BackTile[0])
o introduced procedure SetOffscreenTile()
o introduced procedure FreeImageMem()
o corrected default palette: color #255 should have RGB-triple (0,0,0)
o fixed SetShadowTab() to compare 256 colors (instead of only 255)
o extended SetShadowTab() to handle _very_ strange valued palettes, too
o introduced constant ANIVGAVersion
o rewrote LoadPage(): TP seems to dislike direct BlockReads() into graphic
  memory sometimes
o added 24 fading routines to be thought for nice, eye-catching opening
  sequences
o changed & added the the example programs a bit
o changed DUMP_SPR.EXE to handle very large big sprites correctly
o included TRANSLAT.EXE (a utility of mine) and ANIVGA.DIC which allows you
  to produce an English version of ANIVGA.PAS

All in all, programs done with version 1.0 should run after recompilation with
V1.1 without noticable changes. There are two execptions:
- Because SetShadowTab() now works on the _actually set_ colors, you may call
  this routine not before you switched to graphic, that is: after InitGraph()
  has been called
- If you make use of GetImage(), you have to use the new procedure
  FreeImageMem() as its counterpart (to release memory agian); Dispose() won't
  work as expected
