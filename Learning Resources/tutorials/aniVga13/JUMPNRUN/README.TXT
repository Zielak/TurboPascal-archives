GAME.PAS is a little "Jump 'n Run" game example done with AniVGA V1.1.
Use the "<-" and "->" keys to move around and "CTRL" to jump.

All credits go to Esra Korte & Robin Leeuwerke who wrote it! I did nothing
more than try to translate their Dutch comments into English...
Because they were so kind to release it into the public domain, I could
include its sources here.

I think this is a great example of how to link AniVGA's capabilities together
with other resources, like background playing music, low-level keyboard
handling etc.
